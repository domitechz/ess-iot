# **DAY 5**

**Even if there is only 1% scope of practical demonstration in a topic, still it was done practically to make students understand in depth.**

>Curriculum followed on the day is as follows:

- What is a Transistor

- NPN, PNP, silicon semiconductor, 3 pin device 

- What is BJT  

- circuit symbol 

- Voltage and Current levels in our homes 

- BC547 transistor 

- Transistor as a switch in CE configration

- Transistor datasheets

- **Downloading and reading datasheets**

- Why tranisitor is being used with arduino? - *to drive heavy loads*

- Breadboard circuit with transistor 

- Resistor in series and parallel configration

- Using High power LED with transistor 

- Using Buzzer with transistor 

- What is a coil?

- What is a Electromagnet?

- Relay - diagam, explanation and pinout

- NO NC pins of relay

- Relay circuit connections 

- Overview of SPST, SPDT, DPST, and DPDT switches -  *overview only* 

- Transisitor vs Relay 

- Speaker introdution

- Speaker Circuit 

- Introduction to `tone` function for speaker 

- Digital vs analog pins - *revision*

- **Why are we using arduino, when most tasks can be achieved only with basic electronics?**
