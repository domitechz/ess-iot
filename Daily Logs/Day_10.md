# **DAY 10**



**Even if there is only 1% scope of practical demonstration in a topic, still it was done practically to make students understand in depth.**

>Curriculum followed on the day is as follows:

- DC vs Servo vs Stepper motor- when to use and where to use and  which one

- Introduction to BLDC motors - *overview only*

- Sensors vs Actuators

- Analog signal vs Digital signal

- Continuous vs Discrete signal 

- Interfacing different sensors - current snd resistance mapping  to voltage 

- **LDR** - Light Dependent Resistor

- LDR using resistances with Arduino 

- **Project** : Streetlight on off based on LDR

- Introduction to conversion of project to product - *overview only*

- Introduction to op-amp - *overview only*

- Introduction to LDR module - using it with Arduino

- LDR module vs LDR alone

- Introduction to reed switch - *only practical working shown not coding*

- Introduction to hall sensor - *only practical working shown not coding*
------------
>**Activity : Testing of hall sensor in laptop using magnet**
