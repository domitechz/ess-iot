# **DAY 6**


**Even if there is only 1% scope of practical demonstration in a topic, still it was done practically to make students understand in depth.**

>Curriculum followed on the day is as follows:

- `tone` function

- Using Arduino reference library to understand functions and clear doubts

- Music Notes using `tone` function

- Frequency values of different musical notes

- Sa re ga ma pattern using speaker 

- Reset button in Arduino 

- Homework - Piano code- *using switches to make piano using `tone` function*

- *Shared in class - Mario tone* 

- 8 bit vs 10 bit - `analogWrite` vs `analogRead`

- Address bus and data bus 

- Overview of ADC and  DAC - *overview only*

- Water tank filling alarm system code using `analogRead` and `digitalWrite` with Arduino 

- What are Pseudocodes and Flowcharts 

- Water tank filling alarm system without Arduino using led, transistor and buzzer

>- **Soldering Session** -*students prepared the above system using PCBs and soldering and were allowed to keep their self made projects*

- Moisture sensor with same above system - *used dry and wet sand to demonstrate*

- Introduction to automatic plant watering system - *overview only*
